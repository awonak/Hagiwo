## How to get in touch

If you have any suggestions for improvements with any of the firmwares, the
best way to get in touch is to create an [issue](https://github.com/awonak/HagiwoModulove/issues)
on GitHub. Even better, submit a pull request!

## Email me

anything else on your mind? Shoot me an email at:
